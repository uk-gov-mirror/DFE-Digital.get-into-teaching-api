## POST `/api/teacher_training_adviser/candidates`

Please check existing code and swagger doc for reference. This is a complicated endpoint and I might have made mistakes or missed something here.

**File:** `Controllers/TeacherTrainingAdviser/CandidatesController.cs:54`

### Context

Signs up a candidate for the Teacher Training Adviser service. Validates the request, builds a `Candidate` with extensive business logic (GCSE defaults, qualification, past teaching positions, adviser eligibility, privacy policy, phone call scheduling, subscription), infers degree status from graduation year, serializes with change tracking. Returns the inferred degree status immediately — CRM upsert is async.

The `degreeStatusId` field has historically been set directly by clients (including Apply). However, the GIT website now sends `graduationYear` instead, and the C# API infers `degreeStatusId` from it. The degree status values `222750001` (Final year), `222750002` (Second year), and `222750003` (First year) are stale — they describe a snapshot in time that requires manual CRM updates as the student progresses. The new approach replaces these with `222750006` (Not yet, I'm studying for one) + a `graduationYear` from which the system infers the year/status.

**Clients using this endpoint:** GIT website (main consumer) and Apply.

### Proposal

1. **Reject stale degree statuses**: the API should reject `222750001` (Final year), `222750002` (Second year), and `222750003` (First year) with a validation error. Clients (including Apply) must send `222750006` + `graduationYear` instead.

2. **Graduation year required when studying**: if `degreeStatusId == 222750006` (Not yet, I'm studying for one), then `graduationYear` must be provided. Graduation year is not required and should not be provided for any other degree status (`222750000` Graduate/postgraduate, `222750004` No degree, `222750005` Other).

3. **Keep inference in C# API**: the logic that infers `degreeStatusId` from `graduationYear` (Final year / Second year / First year) stays in the C# API (not moved to CRM or Ruby API). The Ruby API remains "dumb" — it passes `graduationYear` through and lets the C# API handle inference.

4. **Validation stays in C# API**: rather than duplicating validation logic across Ruby and C# APIs, the C# API is the enforcement point for these rules. The behaviour should be clearly documented so the CRM's contract is well-defined.

### Validation changes needed

| Change | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Reject `degreeStatusId` 222750001, 222750002, 222750003 | Return validation error if any of these are sent |
| Require `graduationYear` when `degreeStatusId == 222750006` | New `NotNull` rule gated on studying status |
| `graduationYear` not required for non-studying statuses | `graduationYear` can be null for graduate, no degree, other |
| Existing inference logic unchanged | `GraduationYear` → `DegreeStatusId` mapping remains in `DegreeStatusInference` |
